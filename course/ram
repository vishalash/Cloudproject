To read ream--------fmem
**************************

all ram is stored in /dev/mem-- but after rhel 4 this is disabled in recent version as anyone can read ram


dd if=/dev/mem of=/hi.txt

hexdump -C /hi.txt  /////////   Read binary code

  But fmem driver is used to read ram (written in C language).


  Download fmem driver  extract tar the install
ls -l /dev/fmem
  
in python
x=5
then read from ram
