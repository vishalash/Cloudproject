ssh server--android

           SAMBA server
         ***************

#yum install samba
SMB protocol------>/data123

can share printer,

as win don't understand / and linux don't understand c drive
  we can give a directory name to a path

win full access-admin-500uid
linux-root-0uid

	So,user must be of samba type-- dedicated to samba server

vim /etc/samba/smb.conf
at last
[lw]
path=/movies
valid users=sam  --only sam can access
hosts allow=192.168.2.162 or more ips who want access
# useradd -s /sbin/nologin sam-- can't connect through ssh etc.
# smbpasswd -a sam



systemctl restart and enable smb

Server is now ready

***********************
client- win ,mac,linux
in win(samba client already installed)
in linux(samba client may be installed cifs-utils)
in linux  -- mount -o username=sam //192.168.2.145/lw /media/newd        chmod o+x /lw 
in win--click run then-- \\192.168.2.145\lw
