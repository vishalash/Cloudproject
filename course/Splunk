	Splunk
     ------------

	It is a product.

Behind Technology is oprational intelligence.

machine generated data is much more.

How to use this data...

in a company why any web server is down.

but google search engine can't handle the machine generated relevent data.

This tool can be made with python that can track web servers-->oprational work

But the issue is different...

that is solved by splunk

The problem is ftp server ans webserver or any other all these save logs in differnet ways.

We gonna need a guy who knows every technology... who knows format and location of every server or router.

this can be done by a tool-splunk(operational intelligence technology)
