  Dockers
 =========

	
  samsung -- knox (docker like)

Docker is a company based on conatiners technology.

	install docker-io or engine

systemctl restart docker

when we install a os then hm jha se boot krte hai use image bolte hai.

same in containers when we start vm ... jo layer jiske upar os start honge use docker engine or service or deamon bolenge like hyperviser.

as we had hdd in virtulisation called image same in dockers it is called image.

as we must have image to launch os same in docker we need an image.


	but in the world of docker the os is called #container.


to bring os images go to internet and download

	docker search ubuntu
we can make own image  -- get account on dockers
docker pull
docker save -o ubuntu.tar

docker run -i -t ubuntu   > install boot and then login with a id

exit to close


	people belive that their data is loss after they exit but this is myth as they do docker run.. but it start new os
	but this is due to they run new os , their data is save by just power on that os.
 docker ps -a(all)


docker start ID

docker start attach(attach cmd) ff337b38459f

docker stop id -- to stop from linux command prompt

but id is hard to remember it also give it a nick name

khud ka naam bhi de skte hai

docker run -it --name web1 ubuntu


 ctrl +p +q exit from container but not off.


docker rm ID -- to terminate conatiner permanently  //  chalte hue os ko terminate nhi kr skte phir bhi krna ho to (-f) lgao.

for(i=0;i<10;i++)
do
docker run -i -t ubuntu /but this will enter first docker.. but docker gave an option to run container in background.
done

i=interactive
t=terminal


for(i=0;i<10;i++)
do
docker run -i -t -d --name-lw$i(for unique name) ubuntu (d=demonised)
done

docker attach lw2

docker ps -a -q

echo $(date)

**docker rm -f $(docker ps -a -q) // to remove all containers

own image
