       PYTHON SOCKET PROGRAMMING
   **********************************


	if two programms demanding inputs then we have to focus on it and bring cursor to give input.
	like if gedit and notepad is open
but if we are on network then we can't focus.
we must give program a number(port number) so that client can give the number and can connect to it.


port=1234
x=recv()
print x

	we also need to tell ki kaha le jana he data ko so we must give ip and port number.
  		Ip+port is unique in world
**IP+PORT=SOCKET

import socket

ip="192.168.43.80"
port=1234

bind( (ip,port) )

x=recv()

this is streaming protocol(one of ex. is TCP protocol)

	like in sms we can't know ack.--connectionless
we also can deny that we havnot read sms.

	but this is relaible coz it send ack.
Datagram is connection less and unreliable >>>>>>>>>>>> UDP


 TCP know which client is connectinf but UDP is not.
   
	UDP

import socket
s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_DGRAM,0)
ip="192.168.43.80"
port=1234

s.bind( (ip,port) )

x=s.recv(10)
print x


           #netstat -udlp

client--------
import socket
s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_DGRAM,0)

x=raw_input()

s.sendto(x, ("192.168.43.80",1234))
